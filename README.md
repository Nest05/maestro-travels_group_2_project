- We all have had a moment where we want to get out of the house and spend time with our loved ones or even by ourselves but we did not really know where to go.
- At Maestro travels you can view different hotels/restaurants/parks and even make a booking/reservation.
- For hotel owners/tour guides they can upload your hotel/restaurant on the web app.

- You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
- Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
- There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
